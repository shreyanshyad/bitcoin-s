### What is bitcoin-s?

Bitcoin-S is a loosely coupled set of cryptocurrency libraries for the JVM. They work well together, but also can be used independently. 

This project's goal is NOT to be a full node implementation, rather a set of scalable cryptocurrency libraries that use industry standard tools (rather than esoteric tech often found in cryptocurrency) where possible to make the lives of professional software engineers, security engineers, devops engineers and accountants easier. 

We are rapidly iterating on development with the goal of getting to a set of stable APIs that only change when the underlying bitcoin protocol changes.

If you are a professional working a cryptocurrency business and have feedback on how to make your lives easier, please reach out on [slack] (https://suredbits.slack.com/ssb/redirect), [gitter](https://gitter.im/bitcoin-s-core/) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/Chris_Stewart_5/)!


### Is bitcoin-s production ready?

Please see our latest releases [here] (https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/actions/workflows/release.yml).

Warning! While we try out best to test every pull request in *master*, this branch may not be stable! Bad things can happen to your node! Beware! 

### Can I trust the code in bitcoin-s?

Please audit and verify any and all code in this toolkit for its suitability and validity. This includes reviewing any and all dependencies.

### Getting started (non-developers)

For a complete guide on how to get started with bitcoin-s, see our website at [Bitcoin-S.org](https://bitcoin-s.org). This link is intended for individuals who are just interested in installing bitcoin-s rather than developing. If you are interested in development, see **Getting setup** below.

### Getting setup (developers)

For a complete guide on how to get setup with bitcoin-s, see our website at [Bitcoin-S.org](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/getting-setup). This link is intended for setting up development of bitcoin-s. If you want to just install bitcoin-s rather than develop, see **Getting started** above.
